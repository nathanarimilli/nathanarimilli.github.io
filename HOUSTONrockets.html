            The Houston Rockets are also one of my favorite teams. Out of all the Texas NBA teams, I like the rockets the best by far.

                This team was founded as the San Diego Rockets in 1967 and moved to Houston in 1971 after four losing seasons. The early Rockets teams were led by a pair of future Hall of Famers—Elvin Hayes, who had starred for the University of Houston, and diminutive Calvin Murphy—as well as by Rudy Tomjanovich, who would later coach the Rockets for 12 seasons.

                    My favorite player of all time is from the Rockets: Hakeen Olajuwon. During his 18-year career, Nigeria-born Hakeem Olajuwon staked his claim as one of the greatest players in NBA history. Long considered a physical marvel since his days at the University of Houston, his aesthetic and productive play — highlighted by his Houston Rockets’ back-to-back NBA titles — earned him a place among the game’s best.
