        The OKC Thunder became my favorite NBA team in elementary school because my 3 favorite players in the NBA were all on the team at the same time. Unfortunately, all of these players have left to different teams.

            Founded in 1967, the OKC thunder was originally established as the seattle supersonics, but this organization ended up moving to Oklahoma in 2008.

            Since then, the thunder have produced some of the best players in the league today: Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Russel Westbrook.
